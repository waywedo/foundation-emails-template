# Foundation for Emails Template

[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-emails-template/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/zurb/foundation-emails-template#info=devDependencies)

**Please open all issues with this template on the main [Foundation for Emails](http://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails/issues) repo.**

This is the official starter project for [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails), a framework for creating responsive HTML devices that work in any email client. It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with [Panini](http://github.com/zurb/panini)
- Simplified HTML email syntax with [Inky](http://github.com/zurb/inky)
- Sass compilation
- Image compression
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- Full email inlining process

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 0.12 or greater. The template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Foundation for Emails project:

```bash
foundation new --framework emails
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

## Build Commands

Run `npm start` to kick off the build process. A new browser tab will open with a server pointing to your project files.

Run `npm run build` to inline your CSS into your HTML along with the rest of the build process.

Run `npm run zip` to build as above, then zip HTML and images for easy deployment to email marketing services. 

### Speeding Up Your Build

If you create a lot of emails, your build can start to slow down, as each build rebuilds all of the emails in the
repository. A simple way to keep it fast is to archive emails you no longer need by moving the pages into `src/pages/archive`.
You can also move images that are no longer needed into `src/assets/img/archive`. The build will ignore pages and images that
are inside the archive folder.
